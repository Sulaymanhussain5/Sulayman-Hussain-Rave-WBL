<!--Before developing in HTML, i am setting up a document by adding the styles that will be used to make the page user friendly and intuitive  and it additionally adds a 
bootstrap API which is used to make some of the website dynamic which is based on the class name that has been inserted in each containers. This way it saves time for developers
to style all the component or elements to make the web page user friendly (<link>). Additionally it uses <meta> tag to set up the view point of the screen which is crucial to make 
the system available to different screen size like phones, tablets, desktop (making it responsive). Additionally it uses <meta> tag to insert a UTF (Unicode Transform Unit)-8 which adds 
different type of special characters and special symbols in the website  -->
